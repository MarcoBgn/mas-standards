# Pull requests standards

This is a pull requests style guide for working on moneyadviceservice.org.uk

## To everyone

* Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which
you prefer, and reach a **resolution quickly**.
* Ask for clarification. ("I didn't understand this line. Can you clarify?").
* Ask good questions; don't make demands. ("What do you think about naming this
:user_id?")
* Avoid selective ownership of code. ("mine", "not mine", "yours").
* Avoid judgment and avoid assumptions about the author's perspective.
* Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb",
"stupid"). Assume everyone is intelligent and well-meaning.
* Talk synchronously (e.g. chat, screensharing, in person) if there are too many
"I didn't understand" or "Alternative solution:" comments. Post a follow-up
comment summarizing the discussion.

## Opening a request

## Having your request reviewed

* A common axiom is "Don't take it personally. The review is of the code, not you."
We used to include this, but now prefer to say what we mean:
[Be aware of how hard it is to convey emotion online](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3036748/why-its-so-hard-to-detect-emotion-in-emails-and-texts) and how easy it is to
misinterpret feedback.
* If a review seems aggressive or angry or otherwise personal, consider if it
is intended to be read that way and ask the person for clarification of intent,
in person if possible.
* Keeping the previous point in mind: assume the best intention from the
reviewer's comments.

## Reviewing a request

* Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't.
* Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
* **If discussions turn too philosophical or academic, move the discussion offline**
to a regular Friday afternoon technique discussion. **In the meantime, let the
author make the final decision on alternative implementations**.
* Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered
them. ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?")
* Seek to understand the author's perspective.
